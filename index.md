---

**sandcrawler.js** is a node library aiming at providing developers with concise but exhaustive tools to scrape the web.

---

## Installation

You can install the latest version of **sandcrawler.js** with npm (note that it will install phantomjs for you thanks to this [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phantomjs)):

```bash
npm install sandcrawler
```

You can also install the lastest development version thusly:

```bash
npm install git+https://github.com/medialab/sandcrawler.git
```

---

## Usage

To start using the library, head towards the [Quick Start]({{ site.baseurl/quick_start }}) section for a fast tutorial and you'll soon be able to design the code presented below.

```js
var sandcrawler = require('sandcrawler');

var scraper = sandcrawler.scraper()
  .url('https://news.ycombinator.com/')
  .script('./retrieve-post.js')
  .result(function(err, req, res) {
    console.log(res.data);
  });

sandcrawler.run(scraper, function(err, remains) {
  console.log('Finished');
});
```

## Features

* **Scraper abstraction**: define your scraping jobs easily with the library's chainable methods and run them without further ado.
* **Phantomjs**: Let the library handle [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) for you if you need browser emulation.
* **Complex dynamic scraping**: Need to log into facebook and auto-scroll/expand a full page? sandcrawler is made for you.
* **Static scraping**: You don't need browser emulation? The library will fallback to ye olde static scraping techniques.
* **Scalable and reliable**: Don't lose data within your scraping process anymore thanks to the library's paranoid strategies.
* **Easy prototyping**: Design your scraping scripts in your browser thanks to [artoo.js](http://medialab.github.io/artoo/) and use the same script within sandcrawler to perform the job.
* **Loaded with helpers**: sandcrawler deploys a cosy scraping environment along with [artoo.js](http://medialab.github.io/artoo/) utilities.
* **Fully customizable**: You want really precise headers, a custom user-agent and complex logic? You'll have them all.
* **Reusable logic**: Creating plugins for sandcrawler is really easy. Use already existing ones or build yours to fit your needs.

## Philosophy

**sandcrawler.js** is being developed by scraper developers for scraper developers with the following concepts in mind:

* **Not a framework**: sandcrawler is a library and not a framework so that people can remain free to develop things in their own way.
* **Exhaustivity over minimalist API**: every detail can be customized. This comes with the cost of a bigger footprint for tiny projects but with more reliance for big ones.
* **Asynchronicity**: sandcrawler is not trying to fight the asynchronous nature of client-side JavaScript. If you want to be able to perform complex scraping tasks on modern dynamic websites, you'd better start embracing this asynchronous nature.
* **Better workflow**: sandcrawler aims at enabling developers to design their scraping scripts within their browsers using [artoo.js](http://medialab.github.io/artoo/) so they can automatize them easily afterwards.
