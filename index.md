**sandcrawler.js** is a node library aiming at providing developers with concise but exhaustive tools to scrape the web.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of **sandcrawler.js** with npm (note that it will install phantomjs for you thanks to this [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phantomjs)):

```bash
npm install sandcrawler
```

You can also install the lastest development version thusly:

```bash
npm install git+https://github.com/medialab/sandcrawler.git
```

---

## Bootcamp

Now that you have installed **sandcrawler.js** let's scrape the famous *Hacker News*:

```js
var sandcrawler = require('sandcrawler');

// Defining our scraping task
var scraper = sandcrawler.scraper()

  // Hitting Hacker News' url
  .url('https://news.ycombinator.com/')

  // Running the following client-side script on the page
  .jawascript(function(done) {

    // Using artoo.js to gather data
    var data = $('td.title:has(a):not(:last)').scrape({
      title: {sel: 'a'},
      url: {sel: 'a', attr: 'href'}
    });

    // Notifying that the scraping is done
    done(data);
  })

  // Acting upon result
  .result(function(err, req, res) {

    // Printing scraped data
    console.log(res.data);
  });

// Running task with phantomjs
sandcrawler.run(scraper, function(err, remains) {
  console.log('Finished');
});
```

## Features

* **Scraper abstraction**: define your scraping jobs easily with the library's chainable methods and run them without further ado.
* **Phantomjs**: Let the library handle [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) for you if you need browser emulation.
* **Static scraping**: You don't need browser emulation? The library will fallback to ye olde static scraping techniques.
* **Scalable and reliable**: Don't lose data in your scraping process anymore thanks to the library retries utilities and remains stashing.
* **Easy prototyping**: Design your scraping scripts in your browser thanks to [artoo.js](http://medialab.github.io/artoo/) and use the same script within sandcrawler to perform the job.
* **Loaded with helpers**: sandcrawler deploys a cosy scraping environment ensuring your access to jQuery or cheerio and [artoo.js](http://medialab.github.io/artoo/) if needed.
* **Fully customizable**: You want really precise headers, a custom user-agent and complex logic? You'll have them all.
* **Reusable logic**: Creating plugins for sandcrawler is really easy and enables you to use already existing ones or build yours to fit your needs.

## Philosophy

**sandcrawler.js** is being developed by scraper developers for scraper developers with the following concepts in mind:

* sandcrawler is a library and not a framework so that people can remain free to develop things in their own way.
* sandcrawler is not trying to fight the asynchronous nature of client-side JavaScript. If you want to be able to perform complex scraping tasks on modern dynamic websites, you have to embrace this asynchronous nature.
* sandcrawler aims at enabling developers to design their scraping scripts within their browsers using [artoo.js](http://medialab.github.io/artoo/) so they can automatize them easily afterwards.
